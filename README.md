# Making a diy stream-deck (taqp)

* I want to learn zig, hardware orientated programming and ffi
* Also having a self-made stream-deck is pretty awesome

## The plan...
+ [ ] setup
+ [ ] talk to rust from zig
+ [ ] talk to esp from zig
+ [ ] connect to device from esp
+ [ ] react to physical button press
+ [ ] send data to the gui application running on the device
+ [ ] load config from the gui application
