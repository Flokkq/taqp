# Making a diy stream-deck (taqp)

* I want to learn zig, hardware orientated programming and ffi
* Also having a self-made stream-deck is pretty awesome

## The plan...
+ [ ] setup
+ [x] talk to rust from zig
+ [x] talk to esp from zig
+ [x] connect to esp from device
+ [ ] react to physical button press
+ [ ] send data to the daemon running on the device
+ [ ] load config from the gui application
